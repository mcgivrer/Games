h1. Games, a framework design test

This project is a small framework design test to improve some of the modules to be implemented into WebContext, the other project I am leading, a full featured and industrial PHP framework.

Here are experimented:

* Autoload functionality (no more "require" or include !)
* Debug and trace log (see debug.class.php),
* Configuration purpose,
* Data Persistance in files (text format as temporary source, xml soon, and Database in near futur) with Entity management,
* MVC concept with PageManager and Router,
* Helpers concept,
* Javascript integration with JQuery and some plugins,
* Themes at (Page and Application Level) with templating,
* Internationalization (i18n),
* Standard CMS Image management 
** Image resizing with standard GD library,
** Multi level thumbnailer,
** Images storing following some entity defined rules
* ...

And the list is growing every week !

A lot of features are experimental for now, and not stabilized. So if you want user these, it's at yourown risks ;) 
But if you want to contribute with your own knowledge to these, please feel free to contact "me":mailto:frederic.delorme@gmail.com.

Have fun !
